# Netflix-Clone

This project is a clone of the Netflix landing page, created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate front-end development skills, particularly in designing responsive web layouts and implementing CSS styling. The clone captures the visual essence of Netflix, featuring a header, background images, and a sign-in section, but does not include any backend functionality.

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout of the page.
